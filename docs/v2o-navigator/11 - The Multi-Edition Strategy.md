## Selling the "Platform," not the "Hypervisor"
When a customer sees the price of **Platform Plus (OPP)**, they may experience sticker shock. Our tool uses a "Net Annual Impact" calculation to pivot the conversation.

### The Editions
| Edition | Value Prop | Automation Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OVE** | Replace ESXi | Low (Manual) |
| **OKE** | Basic K8s | Medium |
| **OCP** | Full DevOps | High |
| **OPP** | **Multi-Cluster / ACM** | **Maximum (Policy-Driven)** |

## The "Efficiency Multiplier"
The tool applies a higher **Efficiency Gain (90%)** to the OPP edition because of **Advanced Cluster Management (ACM)**. 

### The Pitch
"While the OPP subscription is $X more expensive than OVE, it reclaims $Y more in engineering hours through automation. This results in a **Lower Net Cost** to the business while providing higher security and scale."
