## 1. The Opening (Discovery)
Start with the **Estate Analysis**. Show the customer their current sprawl. "You have 2,000 vCPUs, but how many of those are actually doing work?"

## 2. The Efficiency Play (Consolidation)
Use the **vCPU Slider**. Show them that at 4:1 consolidation, their footprint shrinks. This is where we justify the move from legacy hardware.

## 3. The 'Gift' (RHEL Savings)
Highlight the **RHEL Dividend**. "You are already paying for these RHEL licenses. With OpenShift, that cost goes to zero."

## 4. The Transformation (People & Process)
Show the **Innovation Fund**. Explain that ACM isn't just a tool; it's how they get their engineers' time back.

## 5. The Close (TCO Chart)
Point to the **Breakeven Point**. "Yes, Year 1 has a migration cost, but by Year 2, the platform has paid for itself."
